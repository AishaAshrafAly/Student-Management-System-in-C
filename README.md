# Student-Management-System-in-C
This repository contains the Student Management System, a project designed as part of the Edges For Training Standard Embedded Systems Diploma. This C-based program provides a straightforward and efficient way to manage student data, focusing on core concepts of data handling, linked lists, and state machine programming.

Project Overview
The Student Management System allows users to:

- Add new students to the system.
- Display all stored student records.
- Search for a student by their unique ID.
- Update student details.
- Delete a student record.
- Calculate the average GPA.
- Identify the student with the highest GPA.


This project demonstrates foundational programming techniques in C, including:

- Control structures: Loops, conditions, and menus.
- Data structures: Usage of structs and linked lists to store dynamic data.
- Pointers: Managing and manipulating linked list nodes.


System Structure
- All student records are stored in a linked list, with each node containing student details and a pointer to the next node.
